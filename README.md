"Space Park" is a group project submission for my Web Development module, as part of my BSc Computer Science degree.

Space Park was created with full collaboration and team input for every plan, change or addition made and we worked in an Agile workflow.

The core concept was that of a theme park and the types of services they provided - for example the tickets section, the dining/shops and the interactive map!
 
A lot of initial planning and research went into existing theme parks today and the services they provided, as well as on their chosen implementation and designs for their respective sites.

This was an immense learning oppertunity as we had to collaborate with students on an international scale, so factors such as timezones, availability, language barriers and the like, had to be planned for to ensure all team members are satisfied, have their needs/commitments supported and so we can work in unison with all members being 'in the loop' at all stages.

Thank you for visiting!
